Collecting simple statistics for how long various implementations of
the same program take to execute is an easy way of empirically
evaluating the pros and cons of tradeoffs debated during the
implementation of a program. We can write a simple script in Bash to
achieve this by utilizing Gnuplot as a plotting utility and some way
to measure time of execution for a process. First, the <code>time</code> keyword
is used in Bash to collect these measurements. Then, an implementation
of a program that allows sub-millisecond measurements to be made is
written and the implications of this are explored.
